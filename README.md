# Data Structure
The project uses a relational sales database consisting of three tables: **customers**, **products**, and **orders**.
These tables are connected using unique identifiers to support accurate sales and customer analysis.

## Table Descriptions
1. **Customers** - This table contains customer-level information and is used to analyze customer demographics and behavior.
2. **Products** - This table stores product-level details and supports product performance and pricing analysis.
3. **Orders** - This is the fact table containing transactional sales data and links customers to products.

# Executive Summary
From **Q1 2019** to **Q2 2022**, the business generated **$45,174** in **total revenue** from **1,000 orders**, with an **average order size** of **47** units, indicating consistently strong basket sizes across transactions. In the pre-pandemic period (2019), **total sales** reached approximately $12.2K, providing a baseline for performance. During the pandemic period (2020–2021), revenue demonstrated resilience and growth, remaining relatively steady at $12.1K in 2020 and peaking at approximately $13.8K in 2021, representing an estimated **13%** growth from 2019 to 2021. This suggests the business was able to sustain and even expand sales despite broader market disruptions.
For 2022, available data covers only **Q1–Q2**, with recorded sales of about **$7.1K**. When viewed in the context of prior years, this half-year performance represents over **50% of 2021’s full-year revenue**, suggesting a **strong early-year sales trajectory**. While full-year conclusions cannot yet be drawn, the first two quarters indicate continued post-pandemic momentum, with revenue generation tracking ahead of historical mid-year benchmarks.
